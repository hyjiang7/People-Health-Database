        <p>
        This database allows us to explore the relationship between people, diseases and the environment in which they live in.
        Everyone in this database has been diagnosed with a certain type of disease(s). We study the progression of their diseases
        by keeping track of the diseases' statuses. We also record the where the people are currently living. Factors such as climate,
        the cleaniness and the populations of their enivornments are all recorded. This database allows us to collect the data and
        analyze how the environment may impact people's health.
