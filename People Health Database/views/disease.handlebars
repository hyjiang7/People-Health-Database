<h1>About Diseases</h1>
<p>
    These are the list of diseases people have been diagnosed with. We add a few attributes about the disease
    including name, hereditary property, lifestyle influence and medicine. Name is the name of the disease.
    The hereditary property is a yes or no property. A yes means the disease is caused by genetics and a no means
    the disease is not caused by genetics. The lifestyle Influence factor is also a yes or no property. A yes
    means a person's lifestyle contributed to the disease while a no means lifestyle has nothing to do with the disease.
    The medicine attribute states the name of the medicine used to cure the disease.
